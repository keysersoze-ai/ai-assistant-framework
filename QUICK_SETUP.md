# Quick GitHub Setup

## 1. Create Repository on GitHub
Go to: https://github.com/new

- Repository name: `ai-assistant-framework`
- Description: "Advanced modular AI assistant framework with memory persistence and reasoning engines"
- Set to **Public**
- DON'T initialize with README (we have one)

## 2. Push Your Code
After creating the repo, run these commands:

```bash
cd /Users/Shared/interview_project

# Add your remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/keysersoze-ai/ai-assistant-framework.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Add Topics on GitHub
After pushing, go to your repo settings and add these topics:
- artificial-intelligence
- machine-learning
- python
- ai-assistant
- memory-management
- reasoning-engine
- nlp
- framework

## 4. Optional: Add a Description
In the repo's About section, add:
"ðŸ¤– Production-ready AI assistant framework with advanced memory persistence, multi-strategy reasoning, and extensible architecture"

## What the Interviewer Will See:
- Clean, professional codebase
- Well-documented with clear README
- Modular architecture showing good design principles
- Advanced concepts (async, memory management, reasoning)
- Proper Python packaging structure
- MIT License (professional touch)

## Test It Works:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

This shows you can build complex, well-architected systems!
